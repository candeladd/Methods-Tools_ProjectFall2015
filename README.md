# Methods-Tools_ProjectFall2015

In this repo you will find the code for a basic robotic arm. We have three servos attached to laser cut acryllic limbs and another servo attached 
to a claw. 
We have  Arduino Unit tests to test to serial ports and input pins under 'Test_Cases'. 
We have source code containing all the code to be upload to an ardunio under 'Source_code'.
