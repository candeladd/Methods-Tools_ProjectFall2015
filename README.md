# Methods-Tools_ProjectFall2015

In this repo you will find the code for a basic robotic arm. We have three servos attached to laser cut acryllic limbs and another servo attached 
to a claw. In order run the code you will need to hook up four servos to an arduino (look at source code for input pin numbers) and upload all the source code to the arduino. 
You can find the source code needed to for the ardunio under 'Source_code'. 
We have  Arduino Unit tests to test to serial ports and input pins under 'Test_Cases'. 
We have the dxf files for the laser cutter under 'Acrylic_Arm_Build/DXF_Laser_ready_files'
We have videos which contain testing videos under 'Videos'
